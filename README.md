# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description
I made this web app to better track what I've learned. It enables me to have a place to refrence what I know, and help jog my memory. It has general info and liks to good sources on topics this allows me to get a general information, but if I require a deeper lesson I can follow a link. It solve so much for me personally, and is a recource I plan on updateing and using for a while.

## Installation


N/A


## Usage

I recommend using chrome dev tools (if your new right click and inspect is a quick way of getting their, If you’re using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I, and if you’re using windows, you can press Control+Shift+I) and move to the Console tab. In the console tab you will see a list of the topics, and a suggested topic to study that will change if you refresh the page. So if you are gennraly studying then you can go for a random one but if you need help on acertin part you can just scroll to the point you need to be at.
