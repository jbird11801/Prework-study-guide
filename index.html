          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <br /> <!-- Dry code but personaly helps me as a end user as i have dyslexia -->
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < style > element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < base > element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < link > element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < meta > element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.  <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp>Read more!</a></li>
          <br />
          <li>The < script > element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Lightly touched utf-8 but can read more <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>here</a></li>
          <br />
          <li> < !DOCTYPE html > is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular < !DOCTYPE html > declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. Note < !DOCTYPE > is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Next, we see the < html > opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element for example you may see inside the < html > tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). </li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase2.PNG" alt="Example of the < html > attribute lang= ''en''" />
          <br />
          <li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Next, we see the < head > opening element. The < head > element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < head > element is a container for metadata. < meta > elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the <head> or <meta> elements. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < title > element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  </li>
          <br />
          <li> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>

          <br />

          <ul>

          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a < body > element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the < body > element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 > is the opening tag and < /h1 > is the closing tag. The content in between those tags is what is rendered on the page</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, and < h6 > elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The closer the number is to zero the biger the text is ie ( h1 is biger than h6 ) </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < p > element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase3.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < p >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < ul >, < ol >, and < li >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The < img > element can contain various attributes</li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase4.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < img >" />
          <br />
          <li> the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <br />
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.(The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.){I understood alt as a alternate version for like a blind person reading hearing it read to him}</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. There is a < br ></li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase5.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < br >" />
          <br />
          <li>the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages </li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase6.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < a >" />
          <br />
          <li> The href attribute points to the URL for the link. The following text is what shows up on the web page </li>
          <br />
          <li> On The Job : Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from < h1 > to < h6 > to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,< h1 >, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <br />
          <li>  The < footer > appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a < p > element that renders "I can code!", as follows:</li>
          <br />
          <img class = "demo" src="./assets/UseCase7.PNG" alt="Image of a use case for < footer >" />
          <br />

            <br />
            <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy.</li>
            <br />
            <li> If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
            <br />
            <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. (<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy>Read more here</a>)</li>

            <br />
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <br />
            <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
            <br />
            <li>The following variable declaration demonstrates how we would represent our group of shapes in an array named shapes:</li>
            <br />
            <img class = "demo" src="./assets/JSDemo12.PNG" alt="Image used to explain arrays being declared" />
            <br />
            <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
            <br />
            <img class = "demo" src="./assets/JSDemo13.PNG" alt="Image used to explain arrays use of multiple data types" />
            <br />
            <li>The example array stores information about a student named Lu, including his name, age, and whether he is currently enrolled</li>
            <br />
            <li>"Lu", is surrounded by quotation marks. That is because Lu is a string, and strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
            <br />
            <li>54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotation marks are necessary for those values.</li>
            <br />
            <li>As you can see, this array contains a string, a number, and a Boolean value.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
            <br />
            <img class = "demo" src="./assets/JSDemo10.PNG" alt="Image used to explain array asassigned index" />
            <br />
            <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
            <br />
            <li>computers start at positon 0 unlike us who start at 1 (don't do a OBOE) they count up by one like us though</li>
            <br />
            <li>Notice that each item is assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array: ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]. Because indices follow a predictable pattern of 0, 1, 2, 3..., we can easily identify the index number by just looking at the array.</li>
            <br />
            <li>If we wanted to access only the triangle, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array, which in our case is shapes. Then we add the index of triangle to the end of the array name in square brackets, as shown in the following line of code:</li>

            <li>For loops are alot but if we break it down its not so bad, but this is the general syntax</li>
            <br />

            <br />
            <li>First we declare a variable to count(I hate x as a variable name I used counter to better understand but if you have multiple for loops TopicCounter would be great) </li>
            <br />
            <li>this lets us count the amout of times the loop has gone</li>
            <br />

            <li>< is a Boolean statement it means less than </li>
            <br />
            <li>shapes.length is 3 because 3 is the highest position in are array  </li>
            <br />
            <li>.length just gets the length of the array no matter what it is</li>
            <br />
            <li>so this is a condiinal statment if x(TopicCounter) is less than shapes.length (3) than do whats next</li>

            <li>x++ is a shorthand for x = x + 1 this lets us count incrementaly ( if x was 2 it would be like 1+ 2(old x) = 3(new x)) {it sets x = to itself plus one}</li>

          <br />
            <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we give our function a unique name. A function's name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
            <br />
            <img class = "demo" src="./assets/JSDemo19.PNG" alt="Image used to explain functions" />
            <br />
            <li>Notice that the syntax is similar to if statements and for loops. The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets {}</li>
            <br />
            <li>We didn't call the function! In order for the code inside a function to run, we need to call the function. (helloWorld();) is what is used to call this function)</li>
            <br />
            <li> Note that it is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>When we declare a function in our JavaScript code, we are creating a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. However, declaring a function does not mean that the code will automatically execute. We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute.</li>
            <br />
            <li>To call a function, we use the name of the function in our JavaScript file where we want the code to execute. Remeber code flow read 3.3.4 notes</li>

            <img class = "demo" src="./assets/JSDemo20.PNG" alt="Image used to explain MATH object" />
            <br />
            <li>Math.random() is a random number generator between 0 and 1 </li>
            <br />
            <li>multiplying Math.random() by topics.length ( see notes 3.3.5 ) gets you a random number between 0 and 3  </li>
            <br />
            <li>Math.floor always rounds down (1.1 = 1 , 1.9 = 1)</li>
            <br />
            <li> so all that math stuff gives you a random integer between 0 - 3 </li>
            <br />
            <li>then its put into the topics array to give you a topic and assigns it to random topic </li>
            <br />
            <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number. (<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math>Read more here</a>) </li>
