        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < style > element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < base > element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < link > element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < meta > element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.  <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp>Read more!</a></li>
          <br />
          <li>The < script > element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Lightly touched utf-8 but can read more <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>here</a></li>
          <br />
          <li> < !DOCTYPE html > is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular < !DOCTYPE html > declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. Note < !DOCTYPE > is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Next, we see the < html > opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element for example you may see inside the < html > tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). </li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase2.png" alt="Example of the < html > attribute lang= ''en''" />
          <br />
          <li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Next, we see the < head > opening element. The < head > element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < head > element is a container for metadata. < meta > elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the <head> or <meta> elements. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < title > element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  </li>
          <br />
          <li> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>

          <h3> Body(<a href=https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/3906/pages/3-dot-1-4-describe-the-body-of-an-html-document?module_item_id=885777>3.1.4</a>)</h3>
          <br />

          <ul>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a < body > element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the < body > element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 > is the opening tag and < /h1 > is the closing tag. The content in between those tags is what is rendered on the page</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, and < h6 > elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The closer the number is to zero the biger the text is ie ( h1 is biger than h6 ) </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < p > element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase3.png" alt="Image of a use case for < p >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase.png" alt="Image of a use case for < ul >, < ol >, and < li >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The < img > element can contain various attributes</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase4.png" alt="Image of a use case for < img >" />
          <br />
          <li> the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <br />
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.(The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.){I understood alt as a alternate version for like a blind person reading hearing it read to him}</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. There is a < br ></li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase5.png" alt="Image of a use case for < br >" />
          <br />
          <li>the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages </li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase6.png" alt="Image of a use case for < a >" />
          <br />
          <li> The href attribute points to the URL for the link. The following text is what shows up on the web page </li>
          <br />
          <li> On The Job : Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from < h1 > to < h6 > to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,< h1 >, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <br />
          <li>  The < footer > appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a <p> element that renders "I can code!", as follows:</li>

The new name that you set will be visible in any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line. If you'd like to keep your real name private, you can use any text as your Git username. Changing the name associated with your Git commits using git config will only affect future commits and will not change the name used for past commits.(<a href=https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer>Read More!!!</a>)</li>

            <li> Remember that we use Git in our local development environment to enable version control. This allows us to easily copy versions of the project files and folders to a local Git branch.

            <br />
            <li> The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>

            <br />
            <li> According to Git, the key to writing effective commit messages is to write them as imperative commands in the present tense.
