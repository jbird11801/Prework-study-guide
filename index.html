          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <br /> <!-- Dry code but personaly helps me as a end user as i have dyslexia -->
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < style > element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < base > element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < link > element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <br />
          <li>The < meta > element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.  <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp>Read more!</a></li>
          <br />
          <li>The < script > element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Lightly touched utf-8 but can read more <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>here</a></li>
          <br />
          <li> < !DOCTYPE html > is a declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular < !DOCTYPE html > declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page. Note < !DOCTYPE > is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive. </li>
          <br />
          <li> Next, we see the < html > opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element for example you may see inside the < html > tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage (in this case, en for English). </li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase2.png" alt="Example of the < html > attribute lang= ''en''" />
          <br />
          <li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <br />
          <li>Next, we see the < head > opening element. The < head > element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < head > element is a container for metadata. < meta > elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the <head> or <meta> elements. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < title > element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  </li>
          <br />
          <li> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</li>

          <br />

          <ul>

          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a < body > element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the < body > element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML. </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 > is the opening tag and < /h1 > is the closing tag. The content in between those tags is what is rendered on the page</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < h1 >, < h2 >, < h3 >, < h4 >, < h5 >, and < h6 > elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. The closer the number is to zero the biger the text is ie ( h1 is biger than h6 ) </li>
          <br />
          <li> The < p > element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase3.png" alt="Image of a use case for < p >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < ul >, < ol >, and < li > elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase.png" alt="Image of a use case for < ul >, < ol >, and < li >" />
          <br />
          <li> The < img > element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The < img > element can contain various attributes</li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase4.png" alt="Image of a use case for < img >" />
          <br />
          <li> the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <br />
          <li>The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.(The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.){I understood alt as a alternate version for like a blind person reading hearing it read to him}</li>
          <br />
          <li> The < br > element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. There is a < br ></li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase5.png" alt="Image of a use case for < br >" />
          <br />
          <li>the < a > element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages </li>
          <br />
          <img src="./assets/UseCase6.png" alt="Image of a use case for < a >" />
          <br />
          <li> The href attribute points to the URL for the link. The following text is what shows up on the web page </li>
          <br />
          <li> On The Job : Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from < h1 > to < h6 > to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,< h1 >, should only appear once on each page.</li>
          <br />
          <li>  The < footer > appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. In our case, we have a <p> element that renders "I can code!", as follows:</li>

              <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.

              <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply </li>
              <br />
              <li> Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property ie the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue </li>

              <li>* is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.  </li>
              <br />
              <li>In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0</li>

              <br />
              <li>we can combined two or more selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors like in the example with h1,h2 they will share the same styling  </li>

              <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. Every day, developers notice errors and review code that isn’t working. It’s important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts.

              <br />
              <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right. </li>
              <br />
              <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray </li>
              <br />
              <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element </li>
              <br />
              <li>the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box) </li>
              <br />
              <li>the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box) </li>
              <br />
              <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex # (<a href=https://htmlcolorcodes.com/>Find Hex numbers here</a>)</li>

            <li> Remember that we use Git in our local development environment to enable version control. This allows us to easily copy versions of the project files and folders to a local Git branch. Working on a copied version allows us to work on the development of the project in isolation in order to test functionality without needing to worry if another team member is also currently working on the project code.</li>

            <li>The git command must precede every Git statement. </li>
            <br />
            <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch. </li>
            <br />
            <li>The -b flag creates a new branch. </li>
            <br />
            <li> The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>

            <li> git commit -m "add starter code" is used to commit (ie how i understand puts it in the cloud to vote on adding to main) and adds a message so you describe what the changes encompass  </li>
            <br />
            <li>In the preceding Git statement, a commit was created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes. Once committed, feature/starter-code will be updated with the starter code. </li>
            <br />
            <li> According to Git, the key to writing effective commit messages is to write them as imperative commands in the present tense. It is good practice to have a single convention on a team for consistency.(<a href=https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines>Read More!!!</a>)</li>

            <br />
            <li> It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code! </li>
